# Orbital Market System  
*(A universal framework applicable to both cryptocurrency and traditional markets)*

---

## Core Elements (Основные элементы)
- **Anchor Asset** = Sun (Center of the "market universe")  
  *(Bitcoin or any other key asset depending on the context)*  
- **Secondary Assets** = Planets on Orbits  
  *(Stocks, altcoins, commodities, and other secondary assets)*  
- **Intermarket Correlation** = Gravitational Link  
  *(The relationship between assets influencing their movement)*  
- **Price Relationship** = Orbital Distance  
  *(Relative price dynamics determined by market forces)*  
- **Blockchain Confirmations** = Event Horizon  
  *(Key levels of confirmation that cannot be reversed once crossed)*  

---

## Asteroids (События, нарушающие орбиты)  
*(Sudden factors causing market disruptions)*  
- **Hard Forks / Splits** = Major Asteroid Collisions  
  *(Network splits or structural changes in an asset)*  
- **Regulatory News** = Gravitational Anomalies  
  *(Legislative changes causing market turbulence)*  
- **Hacks / Bugs** = Cosmic Catastrophes  
  *(Technical failures threatening system integrity)*  
- **Listings on Major Exchanges** = New Gravitational Fields  
  *(New trading platforms or channels changing liquidity)*  

---

## Protection from Asteroids (Защита от внешних шоков)  
*(Risk management strategies to mitigate instability consequences)*  
- **News Monitoring** = Early Warning System  
  *(Tracking events to predict potential risks)*  
- **Stop-Loss Orders** = Shields  
  *(Automatic loss limitation during extreme price movements)*  
- **Diversification** = Different Orbital Planes  
  *(Spreading capital across various asset classes to minimize risk)*  
- **Position Size Management** = Ship Maneuverability  
  *(Optimal allocation of funds for maintaining flexibility)*  

---

## Orbital Mechanics (Механика рынка)  
*(Fundamental principles governing market forces)*  
- **Volatility** = Eccentricity of Orbit  
  *(The level of price fluctuation — higher eccentricity means more unpredictable trends)*  
- **Liquidity** = Stability of Orbit  
  *(Ease of entering/exiting positions without significantly affecting price)*  
- **Mean Reversion** = Orbital Stabilization  
  *(Tendency of price to return to its mean value after deviations)*  
- **Correlation** = Gravitational Influence  
  *(Relationship between assets influencing their joint behavior)*

### Notes:  
1. This text is universal for any market, whether it's crypto, stocks, commodities, or currencies.  
2. The use of the "orbital system" metaphor helps visually represent the relationships and influence of various market forces.  
3. The structure allows easy addition of new elements if necessary for a specific context.
